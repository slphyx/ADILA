# Introduction 

- This is an interactive open software dashboard to estimate expected usage of empirical antibiotic prescription in hospital settings.

- It is a rapid, reproducible and easy-to-use platform that enable users without prior software experience to get expected pattern of empirical antibiotic usage in hospitals.

- The dashboard is part of the Antibiotic Data to Inform Local Action (**ADILA**) project. 

# What you (users) can do:  

- You can get generated tables on expected levels and patterns of empirical antibiotic usage upon entering information on numbers of patients with different infection syndromes, severity of cases, local prevalence of AMR (ESBL and MRSA etc) and numbers of admitted patients in the hospital.
- The outputs are available for two age groups (adults and children) and type of infections. They are also available for overall usage as well as usage disaggregated by antibiotic classes and AWaRe (“Access”, “Watch”, “Reserve”) antibiotic classification.  
- You can visualise the expected estimates.
- You can download output’s tables and figures.
